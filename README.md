# Space-Invaders-V2

Just a Project, I made using Pygame to improve my pygame skills.
The aim of the game, to dodge all of the squares that are falling. 
If you happened, to touch the Square, then the game will automaticaly exit. ( sys.exit() )

The one feature, I added was that whenever you press "SPACE" , your movement speed increases. I got this idea from the game "Osu Catch!". 

Hope you like the game. I will continue to improve my pygame skills.
